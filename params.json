{"name":"RapidIRC","tagline":"Bukkit > IRC plugin for the Rapid Minecraft server","body":"## What is RapidIRC?\r\nRapidIRC is an in-house plugin developed by both @jakelane (aka. Manyman) and I for use on the Rapid Minecraft server. RapidIRC is designed to work with multiple servers, and the bots sit in the IRC channel and relay messages between the in-game chat and the IRC itself.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n# Commands\r\n\r\n***\r\n### In-game commands\r\n```\r\n/irc list\r\n```\r\nReturn a list of users currently in the IRC channel.\r\n```\r\n/imsg [user] [message...]\r\n```\r\nPrivate message a user that is in the IRC channel. Be warned, it does not check whether or not the nick is correct or if the message is correctly sent. Nicks are not case-sensitive.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n### IRC - Messaging\r\n```\r\n/msg [RapidSurvival/RapidCreative] [user] [message...]\r\n```\r\nPrivate message a player in-game through one of the server bots. The bot must be the server that the player is located in. If your IRC client opens a separate private chat window, you can then use the following to send messages, within the private chat with a bot:\r\n```\r\n[user] [message...]\r\n```\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n### IRC - Commands\r\n```\r\n~help\r\n```\r\nReturn a list of commands\r\n```\r\n~players\r\n```\r\nReturn a list of players online (on both worlds)\r\n```\r\n~version\r\n```\r\nReturn the version of the RapidIRC plugin\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nNote: if you receive strange messages beginning with just ```-``` then you have been private messaged by the IRC maintenance bot, Oracle. [You can see what functions Oracle has here.](http://toofifty.github.io/Oracle)\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n# Administration\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n### In-game\r\nAlong with the in-game commands, there are a few commands that may need to be used from time to time. They can be accessed through the /ircOP command.\r\nThese include:\r\n```\r\n/ircop start\r\n/ircop restart\r\n/ircop stop\r\n```\r\nThese commands are extremely self-explanatory, and don't need much further elaboration.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n### In IRC\r\nThere are extra administrative commands that can perform actions in-game. \r\n```\r\n~kick\r\n```\r\nKick a user from the IRC channel (Requires OP in IRC)\r\n\r\n```\r\n~ban\r\n```\r\nBan a user from the IRC channel (Requires OP in IRC)\r\n\r\n```\r\n~pardon\r\n```\r\nUn-ban/pardon a user from the IRC channel, allowing them to return (Requires OP in IRC)\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## Development / Plugin Administration\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nThe plugin should create a config file in it's own folder the first time it is run with Bukkit. Within this file, the variables for the bots are stored and can be changed. Username, channel and server can be edited, along with a few other fields.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nThat's all you need to know about RapidIRC. Check out the [Oracle bot](http://toofifty.github.io/Oracle) to see what functions and features it provides on the other end.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
