{"name":"RapidIRC","tagline":"Bukkit > IRC plugin for the Rapid Minecraft server","body":"## What is RapidIRC?\r\nRapidIRC is an in-house plugin developed by both @jakelane (aka. Manyman) and I for use on the Rapid Minecraft server. RapidIRC is designed to work with multiple servers, and the bots sit in the IRC channel and relay messages between the in-game chat and the IRC itself.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n# Commands\r\n\r\n***\r\n### In-game commands\r\n```\r\n/irc list\r\n```\r\nReturn a list of users currently in the IRC channel.\r\n```\r\n/imsg [user] [message...]\r\n```\r\nPrivate message a user that is in the IRC channel. Be warned, it does not check whether or not the nick is correct or if the message is correctly sent. Nicks are not case-sensitive.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n### IRC - Messaging\r\n```\r\n/msg [RapidSurvival/RapidCreative] [user] [message...]\r\n```\r\nPrivate message a player in-game through one of the server bots. The bot must be the server that the player is located in. If your IRC client opens a separate private chat window, you can then use the following to send messages, within the private chat with a bot:\r\n```\r\n[user] [message...]\r\n```\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n### IRC - Commands\r\n```\r\n~help\r\n```\r\nReturn a list of commands\r\n```\r\n~players\r\n```\r\nReturn a list of players online (on both worlds)\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nNote: if you receive strange messages beginning with just ```-``` then you have been private messaged by the IRC maintenance bot, Oracle. [You can see what functions Oracle has here.](Oracle)\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n# Administration","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
